# CIVITAS-CSE-Release
Mod build for CIVITAS City-States Expanded

v2.0 (also known as the 'Chimp Gone Wild' update)

# RELEASE NOTES

CIVITAS City-States is a rework of the city-state diplomacy system, introducing new city-state types, over 70 new city-states, fourth-tier bonuses, and a handful of customization options that lets you choose how this side of the game is played.

### City-States
We love City-States. We can't get enough of them, nor the dynamic element that they provide. They often play a large role in any game, whether they're friend or foe, so we decided to expand on that dynamic by adding some new city-state types and a whole bunch of city-states to go with them.

### 4th-Tier Type Bonuses
Have you ever felt sorry for Research Labs, Broadcast Centers and other third-tier buildings getting no love from city-states? Well, we've put a stop to that. City-States now offer a 4th-tier type bonus at 10 Envoys, meaning that when jostling for suzerainty with Pericles or Matthias inevitably spirals out of control, you'll at least get a reward for it.

### Fallback System
Let's face it, the new City-State types won't be for everyone. With the option to disable them via the User Settings file, each City-State that is assigned to one of the new types has something to fall back on. This means you can play with none of the new types if you like, and you'll still get all the city-states for them. #NoCSLeftBehind

### User Settings
Speaking of user settings, we figured we'd put the ball in your court and let you be the one to decide how City-States should play. With over 20 sections of options, you can have things your way. Just make sure all participants have the same settings in multiplayer games otherwise you can expect bad things to happen.

### Rulesets
If you're looking for changes on the more complex side of the spectrum, then we will be designing optional rulesets that can be enabled at your leisure. These aren't rulesets that you select in game by the way. In fact, we should probably think of a different name to call them, but given the investment this mod has required, we're feeling pretty lazy so we're just going to roll with it. You can find these rulesets in the CIVITAS City-States collection.

### Bug Reports
